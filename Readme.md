# CI/CD with Jenkins

## DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously.

### Key Principles of DevOps

- **Collaboration**: Enhanced communication and collaboration between development and operations teams.
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks to increase efficiency and reduce errors.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly integrating feedback to improve processes and products.

## CI/CD Workflows

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous delivery.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

CI is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Key practices include:

- Automated testing
- Automated builds
- Frequent commits to the main branch

### Continuous Deployment (CD)

CD is the practice of automatically deploying every change that passes the automated tests to production. This ensures that the software is always in a deployable state.

### Continuous Delivery

Continuous Delivery ensures that the codebase is always in a deployable state, but the deployment to production is a manual step.

## Jenkins

Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to build, test, and deploy their software. It supports various plugins to automate all stages of the CI/CD pipeline.

### Installing Jenkins

1. Download Jenkins from the [official website](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Setting Up a Jenkins Job

1. Open Jenkins in your web browser.
2. Click on "New Item" to create a new job.
3. Enter a name for your job and select "Freestyle project".
4. Configure the source code management, build triggers, and build steps.
5. Save the job and click "Build Now" to run it.

### Example Jenkins Pipeline

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                // Add build steps here
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                // Add test steps here
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                // Add deploy steps here
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

By following this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of DevOps, CI/CD workflows, and how to use Jenkins to automate your software development processes. For more detailed information, refer to the [Jenkins documentation](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/).
